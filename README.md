# Pricing and Distribution Analysis

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on data analysis and reporting for **Pricing and Distribution** in my current role at **Smyrooms**. The notebooks leverage Python and data visualization techniques to explore, optimize, and generate insights related to pricing strategies, distribution channels, and performance metrics.

The objective is to support informed decision-making and drive continuous improvement in operational efficiency.
